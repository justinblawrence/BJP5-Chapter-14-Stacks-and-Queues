/*
Write a method rearrange that takes a queue of integers as a parameter and rearranges the order of the values so that all of the even values appear 
before the odd values and that otherwise preserves the original order of the list. For example, suppose a queue called q stores this sequence of values:

front [3, 5, 4, 17, 6, 83, 1, 84, 16, 37] back
Then the call of rearrange(q); should rearrange the queue to store the following sequence of values:

front [4, 6, 84, 16, 3, 5, 17, 83, 1, 37] back
Notice that all of the evens appear at the front of the queue followed by the odds and that the order of the evens is the same as in the original 
list and the order of the odds is the same as in the original list. You may use one stack as auxiliary storage.

public void rearrange(Queue<Integer> q) {
	Stack<Integer> stack1 = new Stack<>();
    while(!q.isEmpty()){
        stack1.add(q.remove());
    }
    for(int x : stack1){
        if(x % 2 == 0){
            q.add(x);
        }
    }
    for(int x : stack1){
        if(x % 2 == 1 || x % 2 == -1){
            q.add(x);
        }
    }
}
